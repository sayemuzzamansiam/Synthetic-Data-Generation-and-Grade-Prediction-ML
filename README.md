# Synthetic Data Generation and Grade Prediction ML

This project generates synthetic academic data using Java and then applies Python-based machine learning techniques to predict student grades. It serves as an educational tool for understanding how synthetic data can be generated and utilized in predictive modeling, particularly in the context of academic performance.

## Overview

This repository demonstrates a complete pipeline that starts with generating synthetic student performance data and culminates in predicting grades using machine learning. The project is divided into two main parts:
- **Synthetic Data Generation:** Implemented in Java, this part creates realistic academic datasets including variables such as attendance, assignment scores, and exam performance.
- **Grade Prediction using ML:** Using Python (primarily through Jupyter Notebooks), this section preprocesses the data, trains machine learning models, and evaluates prediction accuracy.

This project is ideal for educators, data science enthusiasts, and researchers interested in data simulation and predictive analytics in education.

## Features

- **Synthetic Data Generation:**  
  Uses Java to simulate student performance data. This allows for customization of data characteristics and volume.
  
- **Machine Learning Models:**  
  Implements various ML algorithms (Random Forest) in Python to predict student grades.
  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis:**  
  Jupyter Notebooks are provided for in-depth data visualization and model evaluation.
  
- **End-to-End Pipeline:**  
  Demonstrates a full workflow from data generation to predictive modeling, bridging Java and Python.

## Installation
